# Cypress_CrossBrowserTesting

Cross Browser Testing is the practice of testing your website's functionality and appearance across various web browsers to ensure that it works optimally on all platforms.

It is essential because different browsers have different rendering engines to display web content. For example, Chrome uses the Blink rendering engine while Firefox uses Gecko and Safari uses the WebKit rendering engine.
